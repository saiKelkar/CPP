/*

Guidelines for writing Functions in (perfect) class:
1. private data
2. constructors -- parameters, non-parameters, copy
3. setters (also called mutators)
4. getters (alse called accessors)
5. facilitators (actual functions related to the class)
6. inspectors (to check certain parameters / inquiry -- type bool)
7. destructor

Usually classes just have function prototypes and 
actual functions are defined outside the classes, scope resolution is used to access those functions
