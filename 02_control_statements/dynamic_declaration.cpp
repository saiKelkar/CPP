// local and global memory
// if() { variables declared here are local variables, and memory will be allocated in stack once our code enters the if block }
// anything outside is a part of global memory -- memory allocation in stack when the variables are initialized at the beggining

// for (int i = 0; i < 10, i++) -- i is a local variable
